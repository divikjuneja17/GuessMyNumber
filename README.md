# GuessMyNumber

The goal of this project is to simply guess a secret number between 1 and 20. So, in this input, we can type a number, then we click Check button. On the right side, we get a message saying 'TOO LOW' if your entered number is low from the correct number or 'TOO HIGH' if your entered number is high from the correct number.
Your initial score will be 20, it will decrease by 1 after each guessed fail. If you guessed a correct number, screen will be in green color and a correct number message will be shown and high score will be updated.
If you want to play again, you can click on Again button, it will reset everything except for the highscore.
